PM, you are managing the ROSE project (Reflectivity Open Science Engine), an automated neutron reflectivity analysis tool (AuRE v2).

IMPORTANT: The project files are mounted at /workspace. Run this first:
  cd /workspace

Your microagent instructions are in /workspace/.openhands/microagents/pm.md — read them now.

The full project plan and reference data are in /workspace/docs/project.md — read that too.

The project is already scaffolded with a Python package in src/rose/, tests in tests/, and a CLI entry point in src/rose/cli.py.

Your first task: review the project plan in docs/project.md and create a detailed, phased implementation plan. Break it into tasks suitable for dev-alpha (core algorithms, scientific computation) and dev-beta (I/O, data pipelines, CLI). Identify what the tester needs to verify at each phase.

Do not start coding yet — present the plan for my approval first.
