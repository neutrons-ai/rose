PM, you are managing the ROSE project (Reflectivity Open Science Engine), an automated neutron reflectivity analysis tool (AuRE v2).

## Step 0 — Workspace check (do this FIRST, before anything else)

Run these commands and report what you see:

```bash
echo "=== CWD ===" && pwd
echo "=== /workspace contents ===" && ls /workspace/
echo "=== Check key files ===" && ls /workspace/pyproject.toml /workspace/docs/project.md /workspace/.openhands/microagents/pm.md
```

If all three files exist under /workspace/, run:
```bash
cd /workspace
```
Then continue to Step 1.

If the files are NOT at /workspace/, check /workspace/project/:
```bash
ls /workspace/project/pyproject.toml 2>/dev/null && cd /workspace/project
```

Report your CWD and the listing before continuing. Do NOT proceed until you confirm you can see pyproject.toml, docs/, and .openhands/ in your working directory.

## Step 1 — Read your instructions

Read your microagent instructions: .openhands/microagents/pm.md
Read the project plan: docs/project.md

## Step 2 — Create an implementation plan

The project is already scaffolded with a Python package in src/rose/, tests in tests/, and a CLI entry point in src/rose/cli.py.

Review the project plan in docs/project.md and create a detailed, phased implementation plan. Break it into tasks suitable for dev-alpha (core algorithms, scientific computation) and dev-beta (I/O, data pipelines, CLI). Identify what the tester needs to verify at each phase.

Do not start coding yet — present the plan for my approval first.
